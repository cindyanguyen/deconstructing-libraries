*Final project for 'Deconstrucing Data Science' course taught by Professor David Bamman at the UC Berkeley School of Information, Spring 2016.*

##Introduction
This project focuses on a complex non-English language historical data source--bibliographies of the United States Library of Congress collections of Vietnamese language materials from 1979-1985. We employ a dual approach to this project: a contextualized historical reading and machine learning methods to understand the language, political leanings, and content of the collections and how they change over time.
